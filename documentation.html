    <h1>Comparison of Convex Hull Algorithms</h1>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This documentation aims to compare and analyze the implementation of the
        Jarvis March and Kirkpatrick–Seidel algorithms for finding the convex
        hull in two dimensions.
      </p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Algorithm Descriptions</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Jarvis March Algorithm:</strong> The Jarvis March Algorithm,
        also known as the Gift Wrapping Algorithm, is a method for computing the
        convex hull of a set of points in the plane. It works by selecting the
        point with the lowest y-coordinate and then iteratively selecting the
        point with the next clockwise angle from the previous point until it
        returns to the starting point.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Kirkpatrick–Seidel Algorithm:</strong> The Kirkpatrick–Seidel
        Algorithm is an efficient method for computing the convex hull of a set
        of points in the plane. It works by recursively partitioning the point
        set into subsets, computing the convex hull of each subset, and then
        merging the convex hulls to obtain the convex hull of the entire set.

      <h2>Complexity Analysis</h2>
      <p><strong>Jarvis March Algorithm:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Time Complexity: O(nh), where n is the number of points and h is the
          number of points on the convex hull.
        </li>
        <li>
          Space Complexity: O(h), where h is the number of points on the convex
          hull.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Kirkpatrick–Seidel Algorithm:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Time Complexity: O(n log h), where n is the number of points and h is
          the number of points on the convex hull.
        </li>
        <li>
          Space Complexity: O(n), as the algorithm requires additional space for
          recursive calls.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The choice of algorithm can significantly impact performance, especially
        for large problem sizes. Here's how the complexities may influence the
        decision:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Small Problem Sizes:</strong> For small sets of points, the
          difference in time complexity may not be significant. In such cases,
          the simplicity of implementation of the Jarvis March Algorithm might
          make it preferable.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Large Problem Sizes:</strong> As the number of points
          increases, the O(n log h) time complexity of the Kirkpatrick–Seidel
          Algorithm may provide better performance compared to the O(nh) time
          complexity of the Jarvis March Algorithm. Additionally, the space
          complexity of the Kirkpatrick–Seidel Algorithm being O(n) could be
          more manageable for large datasets.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Nearly Collinear Configurations:</strong> The Jarvis March
          Algorithm performs poorly on sets of points that are nearly collinear
          due to its time complexity being dependent on the number of points on
          the convex hull. In such cases, the Kirkpatrick–Seidel Algorithm, with
          its more efficient time complexity, may be a better choice.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Performance Comparison</h2>
      <p>
        The performance of both algorithms was evaluated using various datasets,
        including small and large point sets with different configurations.
        Empirical results showed that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          For small or moderately sized point sets, the Jarvis March Algorithm
          performed reasonably well and provided simpler implementation.

        <li>
          For large point sets or datasets with nearly collinear configurations,
          the Kirkpatrick–Seidel Algorithm demonstrated superior performance due
          to its optimal time complexity and efficient handling of such cases.

        Overall, the choice of algorithm depends on the specific requirements of
        the problem, including the size and characteristics of the input data,
        as well as considerations regarding implementation complexity and
        efficiency.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        In conclusion, both the Jarvis March and Kirkpatrick–Seidel algorithms
        are effective methods for finding the convex hull in two dimensions.
        While the Jarvis March Algorithm offers simplicity and ease of
        implementation, the Kirkpatrick–Seidel Algorithm provides superior
        performance, especially for large datasets and nearly collinear
        configurations. The choice between the two algorithms depends on the
